def get_blueprint_from_context():
    ''' 
    Implicitly find the Blueprint (if there is one) that the view function is hooked into

    Why do?
        When the view functions are registered in the Flask app, there's actually a prefix on
    routes defined by a Blueprint under the hood.  This allows the same method name to exist
    on multiple blueprints without overwriting the previous view functions with the same name.

    Important note on the metadata decorator: we have to assume we're running before the app
    even exists. 

    Why this matters?
        This means we don't have the luxury of copying Flask's homework and just using the names
    of the view functions it generates (which would have the blueprint prefix) so we imitate it.

    We'll infer the view function name (based on the __name__ of the view function we're passed
    in the decorator, which is the parent function) and try to find a blueprint in the context one
    frame above the decorator, which will be the source file where the route is declared.  From
    there, we'll have access to the __name__ attribute on the blueprint, and can generate an
    accurate key to store the route metadata.  From there, when the Flask app is created and the
    Swagger buldup starts, we'll be able to lookup the routes as they're hooked into the Flask 
    app to see if we've squirreled away any metadata for it.  Simple enough, right?
